# LSTM-Text-Generator

* Character-based LSTM Recurrent Neural Network that generates new text based on given Wikipedia text.
* I downloaded the data from https://metamind.io/research/the-wikitext-long-term-dependency-language-modeling-dataset/.

* LSTM recurrent neural network architecture coded in Tensorflow that learns from game of thrones textbooks to generate new text.
